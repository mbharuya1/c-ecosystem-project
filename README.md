Ecosystem Simulation Project – Predator–Prey Model (C Programming)

This project implements a full ecosystem simulation modeling interactions between predators and prey on a 2D grid.
It was developed as part of the Licence Informatique – C Programming / Ecosystem Modeling coursework at Sorbonne Université.

The instructor provided base structures and function prototypes in ecosys.h.
All algorithmic implementations were completed by the students inside ecosys.c, main_ecosys.c, and the test programs.

Project Overview

This project builds a complete simulation engine for a predator–prey ecosystem, including:

Representation of animals (position, direction, energy, linked list structure)

Movement rules with probabilistic direction changes

Eating behavior (predators eat prey, prey eat grass)

Energy management (energy gain/loss, death when energy ≤ 0)

Reproduction of animals

Regrowth of grass over time

ASCII-based visualization of the world grid

Reading/writing ecosystems to and from text files

The simulation evolves over discrete time steps, updating animals, the environment, and producing population statistics.

Project Structure

ecosys.c
Main implementation file.
Contains all functions for creating animals, adding/removing them, movement rules, reproduction, eating, refreshing predators and prey, refreshing the world grid, and ecosystem display.
Most of the project logic is implemented here.

ecosys.h
Header file provided by the instructors.
Defines the Animal struct, global parameters, function prototypes, world size, and external variables.
Students use this file but do not modify its structure.

main_ecosys.c
Main simulation program.
Initializes predators and prey, runs the ecosystem loop, updates the world, prints ASCII visualizations, and writes population evolution to Evol_Pop.txt.

main_tests.c
Test program used to validate functions such as creation, movement, reproduction, display, and list manipulation.

main_tests2.c
Additional validation program that tests reading and writing ecosystems files, removing animals, and verifying behavior consistency.

Evol_Pop.txt
Output file generated by main_ecosys.c.
Stores the population sizes over simulation time (step preyCount predatorCount).

sys.txt
Text file used to store or reload a saved ecosystem (used by main_tests2.c).
Contains positions, energies, and directions of all animals.

Makefile
Allows compiling the entire project (make), test programs (make tests), and cleaning object files.

a.out
Binary generated after compilation (if no specific output name is provided).

The files modified by the students are primarily:

ecosys.c

main_ecosys.c

main_tests.c

main_tests2.c

Implemented Functions
Animal & List Management

creer_animal(x, y, energie) — create a new animal

ajouter_en_tete_animal(liste, a) — push in front of list

ajouter_animal(x, y, energie, &liste) — create and add animal

enlever_animal(&liste, a) — remove an animal from the list

liberer_liste_animaux(liste) — free all animals

Movement & Behavior

bouger_animaux(liste) — move each animal with probabilistic direction changes

reproduce(&liste, p) — reproduce animals with probability p

Prey & Predator Updates

rafraichir_proies(&liste_proie, monde)
Moves prey, decreases energy, removes dead animals, allows them to eat grass, and reproduces them.

rafraichir_predateurs(&liste_predateur, &liste_proie)
Moves predators, decreases energy, lets predators eat prey, removes dead predators, and reproduces them.

World & Display

rafraichir_monde(monde) — regrows grass over time

afficher_ecosys(pred, proie) — ASCII display of world grid

animal_en_XY(liste, x, y) — find an animal at coordinates

File I/O

ecrire_ecosys("file", pred, proie) — save ecosystem to a text file

lire_ecosys("file", &pred, &proie) — reload ecosystem from a file

All functions were tested using the provided test programs.

Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates strong understanding of:

C programming fundamentals (pointers, structs, recursion, linked lists)

Simulation and probabilistic modeling

Memory management (malloc/free)

Environmental dynamics and agent-based modeling

File parsing and serialization

Separation between interface (ecosys.h) and implementation (ecosys.c)

Modular programming and multi-file compilation
